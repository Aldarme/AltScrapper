## OverView
AltScrapper project is a web scrapper which automates the addition of elevation data in '.km*' file.

This project is based on the operation of "GPS Visualizer" website.

"GPS Visualizer" website allows you to add elevation data in '.km*' file.
But the major problem is that you can only upload and download files manually.

In my case, working with more than several hundred files, I need to automate the converting process.

Thus, with AltScrapper, you can automate the addition of elevation data on multiple files.
